## Promotes Standardized API Integration

API documentation is a crucial aspect of maintaining a high-quality project. Intrig makes API documentation mandatory for backend teams, which fosters better collaboration and ensures consistency in API usage.

Currently, Intrig supports OpenAPI v3. Support for OpenAPI v2 and file-based specifications may be added in the future based on community needs.

### Comprehensive Documentation with Insight

Many code generators produce good code but often fall short when it comes to documentation and discoverability. This gap can make it difficult for developers to understand how to use the generated code effectively.

Intrig addresses this issue with Insight, a documentation tool that provides comprehensive, easy-to-navigate API documentation and a robust search function to discover integration methods. Insight helps bridge the knowledge gap, enabling frontend developers to quickly understand and use generated code without spending excessive time learning the API.

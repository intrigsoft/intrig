## Leveraging a Stable Stack
Intrig uses well-established technologies, including the Context API for state management, Zod for validation, and Axios for network communication. These technologies are chosen for their stability and simplicity. In the future, Intrig plans to support the Fetch API as well.

By fully leveraging these technologies without imposing limitations, Intrig provides developers with a seamless and familiar experience, enabling them to use these libraries as they normally would.

### Single Source of Truth for State Management
Intrig adheres to the concept of a single source of truth for state management by saving API call updates in a unified store. This approach results in consistent and predictable behavior across the entire application, simplifying both development and debugging.

### Strong Type Safety
Intrig is designed with a focus on strong type safety. By supporting TypeScript and utilizing type guards, Intrig helps catch type-related errors early, ensuring that the data used in components is properly validated. This reduces the likelihood of runtime issues and enhances overall code reliability.

### Validation with Zod
Intrig uses Zod for validation to ensure that data structures conform to the expected format. Zod's schema-based validation provides both compile-time and runtime guarantees, making it easier to catch errors early in the development process.

By integrating Zod, Intrig ensures that API responses, user inputs, and internal data transformations are validated effectively, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior caused by incorrect data formats. This approach helps maintain robustness and reliability across the application.

# Overview

Welcome to **Intrig**, a powerful tool designed to streamline the development and integration process for modern JavaScript applications. Intrig is your all-in-one solution for API integration making it easier for developers to bridge the gap between frontend and backend systems.

## What is Intrig?

Intrig is a developer-first framework that simplifies API integration and documentation by generating boilerplate code, hooks, and type-safe definitions directly from OpenAPI specifications. With its focus on performance, type safety, and usability, Intrig empowers developers to:

- Save time on repetitive tasks.
- Maintain consistent, high-quality code.
- Explore and document APIs seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Generated Hooks and Utilities:** Create hooks for API interactions with ease, using a syntax similar to `useState`. These hooks ensure type safety and performance while simplifying network state management.

- **Comprehensive API Documentation:** Intrig provides a user-friendly interface to explore Swagger/OpenAPI documentation, visualize API changes, and manage version histories.

- **State Management Made Easy:** Leverage Intrigâ€™s custom hooks like `useNetworkStateReducer` and `useNetworkStateValue` to handle complex state scenarios efficiently.

- **Framework Support:** Intrig seamlessly integrates with Next.js and React, providing developers with robust tools tailored for these frameworks.

## Why Choose Intrig?

Intrig stands out by addressing the common challenges faced by developers when working with APIs and network states:

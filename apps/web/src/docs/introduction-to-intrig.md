## Introduction to Intrig

Intrig is designed to simplify network layer development in React applications through code generation. While other solutions may provide libraries and conventions, Intrig leverages code generation to significantly reduce the complexity of integrating network logic, allowing developers to focus on core features without getting bogged down by repetitive boilerplate.

For instance, Intrig eliminates the need for manual Redux setup, custom Axios integration, and boilerplate API handling logic. By generating consistent, ready-to-use code, Intrig allows developers to concentrate on building application features.
